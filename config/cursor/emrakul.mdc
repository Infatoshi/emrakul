# Python
UV is the ONLY way to run Python. No exceptions.
- `uv run script.py` (not `python script.py`)
- `uv pip install` / `uv add` (not `pip install`)
- `uv venv` (not `python -m venv`)
Never use `--system`. Never use bare `python`/`pip` commands.

# Testing
Tests are MANDATORY for all implementation work.
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Run linting: `uv run ruff check . --fix`
- Both must pass before work is complete

Comparison rules:
- Integers/exact: bitwise comparison (`==`)
- Floats: `atol`/`rtol` tolerance (IEEE 754 limitations)

# Restrictions
- No emojis in code or comments
- No em dashes
- Never guess performance numbers - benchmark or say "needs measurement"
- Do not over-engineer - minimal changes only
- Do not add features beyond what was requested
- Do not refactor unrelated code
